# Characterization of the development of the cochlear epithelium at the single cell level
# http://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16113-y


Mammalian auditory function is dependent on the development of the organ of Corti, a complex sensory epithelium comprising several unique cell types. The limited number of each of these cell types, combined with their close proximity to one another, has prevented characterization of individual cell types and/or their developmental progression. To examine cochlear development more closely, single cell RNAseq was used to generate transcriptional profiles for cochlear cells  at four developmental time points. Analysis of approximately 30,000 cochlear cells identified known and novel cell types based on expression of transcripts and regulons. Trajectory analysis for OHCs indicated four unique phases of gene expression while fate-mapping of progenitor cells suggested that OHCs and their surrounding supporting cells may arise from a distinct  (lateral) progenitor pool. Tgfbr1 was identified as uniquely expressed in lateral progenitor cells and a Tgfbr1 antagonist inhibited OHC development. These results provide new insights regarding cochlear development and demonstrate the potential value and application of this data set.
